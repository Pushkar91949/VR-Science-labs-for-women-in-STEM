# VR Science Lab for Women in STEM Careers

## 🚀 Project Overview
**VR Science Lab** is an innovative virtual reality platform designed to help women in STEM careers stay engaged with hands-on experiments and research during career breaks. Many women face challenges when stepping away from work due to marriage, childbirth, or caregiving. This project aims to keep them connected with their field, maintain confidence, and ensure a smoother reintegration into the workforce.

## 🎯 Why This Project?
### Challenges Faced by Women in STEM:
- Losing hands-on experience
- Skills becoming outdated
- Lack of confidence to return
- Limited professional networking

### The Problem
- Over **40% of women** in full-time science jobs transition to part-time roles or exit after their first child.
- **Married women with PhDs** are 11% less likely to remain in STEM than their single counterparts.
- Women returning from breaks often struggle with professional networks and career progression.

### The Solution
- **VR Science Lab** provides a **real-world experiment environment** in physics, chemistry, and biology.
- Accessible **anytime, anywhere** with a VR headset.
- **Hands-on and interactive learning** instead of passive content.
- **Collaborative virtual rooms** for teamwork, simulations, and networking.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Unity VR** (Game Engine)
- **C#** (Scripting)
- **Oculus SDK / OpenXR** (VR Integration)
- **3D Modeling** (for lab simulations)
- **Photon / Mirror Networking** (for collaboration)

## 🔥 Key Features
### 🎓 VR Labs
- Realistic experiments in **biology, chemistry, and physics**.
- Interactive **hands-on learning and practice**.
- Immersive research tools to keep users engaged.

### 🤝 Collaborative Room
- Simulations to **practice collaboratively** with peers and colleagues.
- **Virtual meetings & group projects** for networking.
- Recreates a **professional lab environment** to retain work-related skills.

## 🎯 Impact & Future Potential
- Helps **reduce dropout rates** by keeping women engaged in STEM.
- Can be adopted by **universities & research labs** for flexible learning.
- Expandable to **engineering, medical, and industrial training**.
- Encourages **continuous learning** during career breaks.

## 📦 Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- **VR Headset** (Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, or compatible device)
- **Unity 2021+**
- **Oculus SDK or OpenXR Plugin**
